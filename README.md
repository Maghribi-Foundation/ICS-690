# Welcome to ICS 690!

In this course we'll be collaborating on a DAO blockchain project.

What is blockchain technology? What is decentralization? What is the future of this technology and its relation to business and society?  

Our goal is to understand the answers to these questions on a deep and practical level. I’ll provide the theory and give you technical goals. 
1. Work your way through the tutorials and put that programming knowledge into use. 
2. Collaborate on a new network/startup/DAO with your class members.  

Perspective: Group work sucks. But it's essential for business. Our work is not valuable if we don’t get off the ground, so don’t be jealous or selfish. At the same time, fair compensation/recognition is essential or we’ll fail. … How to resolve this? We just muddle through. If we’re are honest and generous, it will work. If we’re not, it won’t. Don’t waste your time with quarreling with someone who is trying to get credit they don’t deserve. We’re all guilty of this at some time. Move on and collaborate with someone who generously creates value. Help them instead. You need to be as generous, diligent, and honest as possible to make a group project work.

Failing at this group project is the most likely outcome—-most startups fail. But it’s still a valuable lesson in learning how to collaborate, and how not to collaborate. 

### Grades: 
The hope is to get the whole group to develop a single DAO/Network. We’ll start with a vision I’ve created. Hopefully we’ll end with a completed DAO. Quite likely it will “fork” and people will go off on their own project. [That’s OK!] But if it doesn’t fork, here’s what could possibly result.
-	 Each student in the class will have contributed to some aspect of building a functional decentralized network, initially titled, The Maghribi Foundation.
   -  Gain working knowledge of how to use and develop P2P tools in a blockchain context.
   -  Completing the foundation may contribute to your master’s thesis, or possibly you may complete your whole master’s thesis if the final writeup is good enough.
   -  I have a book contract with De Gruyter’s for writing a text. If you contribute well, I’ll add you to the acknowledgments. If you contribute a lot, make great documentation, and allow me to use it for the book, you can be a co-author. Whatever website or GitHub repository or YouTube marketing video we manage to construct, we’ll feature the contributors’ names prominently. If it’s successful it’s a line in your resume. 
   -  The DAO may work. So you may have an architect’s credit for a new type of economic organization that history has never seen before. You may be a zillyunaire. You may transform human behavior. You may save humanity. Odds of that happening? Not very high. But in no other class have I every seriously posited the possibility. I’m a mathematician. I teach about things that are at least 400 years old each time I step in front of a class. It’s a very weird fact about this moment in history and technology that you might end up changing the world with the things we produce in this class.

If it does FORK catastrophically, then that stuff won’t happen. But at least you’ll viscerally understand the impact of network forks. None of the above outcomes are necessary to successfully complete this class—-the minimum requirement is to finish a final writeup reviewing what you learned in the class. (If you contribute less, then your final writeup is more important. If your contributions are clear and substantial, the writeup is less important.)

Grades at the end of the class are only an issue if we fork into too many groups and get into individual projects. Then your grade will be based on your individual writeup. Otherwise your grade is based on your documented contributions… GitHub, weekly presentations, show me your finished tutorials, show me your collaboration and work… 

### The goal of the Maghribi Foundation: Creating a system for using reputation tokens to motivate and direct a DAO.

  
Here’s the deal: we want to “move fast and break things” with this startup. We will make suggestions and implement them quickly. We’ll fail spectacularly. The things we create will be big mistakes. But we keep moving and improve. Each mistake makes us wiser, humbler, stronger, more determined and confident we’ll succeed.
